# IP-Atlas
This project includes two Python scripts that gather information about IP addresses. The first script utilizes GeoIP2 to fetch details like city, country, and ASN information. The second script calls the ipinfo.io API for similar data, including organization and abuse reports. Both scripts enhance user interaction for efficient network analysis.
